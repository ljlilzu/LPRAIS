# LP<sub>RAIS</sub> -- Link Prediction in Multiplex Networks using a Novel Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making Approach

The code and data for the paper "Link Prediction in Multiplex Networks using a Novel Multiple-Attribute Decision-Making Approach" resubmitted to *Knowledge-based systems*. The code is implemented in Python 3.6.



The code in version 1 indicates the first version of LP<sub>RAIS</sub>, in which the layer similarity measure is used, and that in version 2 denotes the modified LP<sub>RAIS</sub>, in which the layer similarity measure is not used.



The experiments in Sec. 4.1 - 4.3 were conducted according to version 1, and those in Sec. 4.4 - 4.5 were executed according to version 2. 



The code of the compared supervised method can be available from https://github.com/ljlilzu/MultiSup.

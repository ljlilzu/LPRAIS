 The code in version 1 indicates the first version of LP<sub>RAIS</sub>, in which the layer similarity measure is used, and that in version 2 denotes the modified LP<sub>RAIS</sub>, in which the layer similarity measure is not used.

The experiments in Sec. 4.1 - 4.3 were conducted according to version 1, and those in Sec. 4.4 - 4.5 were executed according to version 2.
